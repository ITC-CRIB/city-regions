# A worldwide delineation of multi-tier city-regions

Urban centres shape societies, but there is no systematic global approach analysing how countries are organized around multiple urban centres. We advance understanding by delineating 6,100 cityâ€“regions worldwide using a novel framework classifying 30,000 urban centres into four population tiers. By mapping nested catchment areas based on travel time accessibility, we quantify interconnectedness among urban centres and with their surrounding areas. 

This repository contains scripts that were used to create the global city-regions dataset, which is available at <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10512398>.
